<font face="STCAIYUN">
　
On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair<br>
子夜荒原,风啸吾鬓.<br>
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air<br>
燥风鼓涌,气蒸腾迷.<br>
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light<br>
引首彼方,灯火豆荧.<br>
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim<br>
昏弱已极,抬眼欲迷.<br>
I had to stop for the night There she stood in the doorway;<br>
渴求投栖,忽见娉婷.<br>
I heard the mission bell And I was thinking to myself, "This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"<br>
恍惚存疑,未知何地?<br>
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way<br>
烛炬微燃,示吾前行.<br>
There were voices down the corridor, I thought I heard them say...<br>
骤闻歌泣,侧耳倾听.<br>
"Welcome to the Hotel California<br>
幸哉行者,至此仙境.<br>
Such a lovely place, Such a lovely face<br>
福地洞天,妙颜清丽.<br>
Plenty of rooms at the Hotel California<br>
客舍俨然,轩室无尽.<br>
Any time of year, you can find it here "<br>
何时来此,永可欢愉.<br>
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends<br>
伊人心深,曲丝琉璃.<br>
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends<br>
宝鞍良驹,少年如云.<br>
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat.<br>
庭院蹁跹,蜜汗甜雨.<br>
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget<br>
或舞为忘,或舞为忆.<br>
So I called up the Captain, "Please bring me my wine" He said, 'We haven't had that spirit here since 1969'<br>
唤仆取酒,答已久磬.<br>
And still those voices are calling from far away, Wake you up in the middle of the night<br>
远歌遥吟,震耳惊心.<br>
Just to hear them say...<br>
幽幽一曲,行者何幸!<br>
"Welcome to the Hotel California Such a lovely place，Such a lovely face<br>
福地洞天,妙颜清丽.<br>
They livin' it up at the Hotel California What a nice surprise, bring your alibis"<br>
沉醉纵乐, 何顾德行.<br>
Mirrors on the ceiling, The pink champagne on ice<br>
粉冰沉醴,玉镜莹莹.<br>
And she said 'We are all just prisoners here, of our own device'<br>
吾辈为囚,臣服诸欲.<br>
And in the master's chambers, They gathered for the feast<br>
堂室辉煌,开宴相聚.<br>
They stab it with their steely knives, But they just can't kill the beast<br>
剑影刀光,狂舞无益.<br>
Last thing I remember, I was running for the door I had to find the passage back to the place I was before<br>
惊惶疾奔,逃寻归径.<br>
Relax,' said the night-man,<br>
侍者低语,佳客莫惊,<br>
" We are programmed to receive.<br>
吾等相守,永来伺宾.<br>
You can checkout any time you like,<br>
君既来此,莫思相离.<br>
but you can never leave!"<br>
告别无期,在此心狱!<br>
