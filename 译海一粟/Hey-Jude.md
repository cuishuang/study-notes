Hey jude, don’t make it bad 

吾侄朱得 勿自伤情

Take a sad song and make it better 

抚琴奏曲 歌以咏志

Remember to let her into your heart 

将之汝心 将之汝命

Then you can start to make it better 

含苞待放 实可至也

Hey jude, don’t be afraid 

吾侄朱得 勿忧勿惧


You were made to go out and get her 

朱门开启 佳人欢颜


The minute you let her under your skin

 将之肌肤 如影随形


Then you begin to make it better 

含苞待放 实可至也

And anytime you feel the pain, hey jude, refrain

吾侄朱得 痛勿轻陈

Don’t carry the world upon your shoulders 

山雨欲来 之关门


For well you know that it’s a fool who plays it cool

愚夫献雅 鸡犬相闻


By making his world a little colder

阴沟调醋 暗自伤神

Hey jude, don’t let me down

吾侄朱得 勿欺吾盼

You have found her, now go and get her

朝识佳人 夕归为伴

Remember to let her into your heart

将之汝心 将之汝命


Then you can start to make it better

含苞待放 其可至也

So let it out and let it in, hey jude, begin

吾侄朱得 花开堪折 将启程


You’re waiting for someone to perform with

红袖添香 时不我待


And don’t you know that it’s just you

非寒三日 尺冰何在

Hey jude, you’ll do

吾侄朱得 君须谨记
The movement you need is on your shoulder 

鲈鱼鲜美 结网先行

Hey jude, don’t make it bad 

吾侄朱得勿自伤情

Take a sad song and make it better 

聆彼伤曲，心复又晴


Remember to let her into your heart 

深切勿忘，请君入心

Then you can start to make it better 

由是我知，心复又平

Hey jude, don’t be afraid 

吾侄朱得，勿要惶惶

You were made to go out and get her 

轻启朱门，求彼伊芳

The minute you let her under your skin 

欢聚时辰，护彼在怀

Then you begin to make it better 

由是我知，花开愈旺

And anytime you feel the pain, hey jude, refrain 

若彼成殇，克之制之

Don’t carry the world upon your shoulders  

三寸之肩，何担天下


For well you know that it’s a fool who plays it cool 

汝当了悟，抑之愚矣

By making his world a little colder 

惟余卿心，冷而复寒

Hey jude, don’t let me down 

吾侄朱得，勿负我望

You have found her, now go and get her 

既已寻彼，求之伊芳


Remember to let her into your heart

 深切勿忘，请君入心

Then you can start to make it better 

由是我知，花开愈旺

So let it out and let it in, hey jude, begin 

畅诉幽肠，至彼伊芳

You’re waiting for someone to perform with 

三生等待，与子同裳
And don’t you know that it’s just you 

何为不知，卿本此样


Hey jude, you’ll do 

吾侄朱得，为之苍茫

The movement you need is on your shoulder 

汝需所行，见彼肩上
