Hello darkness, my old friend,<br>
寂静吾友，君可安然。<br>
I've come to talk with you again,<br>
又会君面，默语而谈。<br>
Because a vision softly creeping, Left its seeds while I was sleeping,<br>
浮光掠影，清梦彷徨。<br>
And the vision that was planted in my brain ，Still remains<br>
幽幽往昔，慰我心房。<br>

Within the sound of silence. In restless dreams I walked alone<br>
寂静之声，孤独过往。<br>
Narrow streets of cobblestone, 'Neath the halo of a street lamp,<br>
迢迢陋巷，回声辗转。<br>
I turned my collar to the cold and damp When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light<br>
薄襟何耐，子夜灯凉。<br>
That split the night，And touched the sound of silence.<br>
忧伤流布，寂寞声残。<br>

And in the naked light I saw，Ten thousand people, maybe more.<br>
忽而望之，灯下熙攘。<br>
People talking without speaking, People hearing without listening,<br>
无声而言，无事而忙。<br>
People writing songs that voices never share ，And no one dare Disturb the sound of silence.<br>
妙音难享，曲成即藏。<br>
"Fools" said I, "You do not know Silence like a cancer grows.<br>
愚者何知，寂静如伤。<br>

hear my words that I might teach you, Take my arms that I might reach you."<br>
且相携手，听我衷肠。<br>
But my words like silent raindrops fell, And echoed In the wells of silence<br>
寂静雨珠，连落难断。<br>
And the people bowed and prayed ，To the neon god they made.<br>
造神祈祷，正经虔然。<br>
And the sign flashed out its warning, In the words that it was forming.<br>
警语宣诫，且莫失忘。<br>

And the sign said, "The words of the prophets<br>
are written on the subway walls<br>
And tenement halls."<br>
万千心语，谁知其详？<br>

And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.<br>
In the sounds of silence<br>
In the sounds of silence<br>
唯尔寂静，轻声永传。<br>
