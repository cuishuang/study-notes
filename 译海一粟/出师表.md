臣亮言：先帝创业未半而中道崩殂，

Permit me to observe: the late emperor was taken from us before he could finish his life`s work, the restoration of Han.


今天下三分，益州疲弊，此诚危急存亡之秋也。

Today, the empire is still divided in three, and our very survival is threatened.


然侍卫之臣不懈于内，忠志之士忘身于外者，

Yet still the officials at court and the soldiers throughout the realm remain loyal to you, your majesty.


盖追先帝之殊遇，欲报之于陛下也。

Because they remember the late emperor, all of them, and they wish to repay his kindness in service to you.


诚宜开张圣听，以光先帝遗德，恢弘志士之气，

This is the moment to extend your divine influence, to honour the memory of the late Emperor and strengthen the morale of your officers.


不宜妄自菲薄，引喻失义，以塞忠谏之路也。

It is not time to listen to bad advice, or close your ears to the suggestions of loyal men.


宫中府中，俱为一体，陟罚臧否，不宜异同。

The court and the administration are as one. Both must be judged by one standard.


若有作奸犯科及为忠善者，宜付有司论其刑赏，

Those who are loyal and good must get what they deserve, but so must the evil-doers who break the law.


以昭陛下平明之理，不宜偏私，使内外异法也。

This will demonstrate the justice of your rule. There cannot be one law for the court and another for the administration.


侍中、侍郎郭攸之、费祎、董允等，此皆良实，志虑忠纯，是以先帝简拔以遗陛下。愚以为宫中之事，事无大小，悉以咨之，然后施行，必得裨补阙漏，有所广益。

Counselors and attendants like Guo Youzhi, Fei Yi, and Dong Yun are all reliable men, loyal of purpose and pure in motive. The late Emperor selected them for office so that they would serve you after his death.These are the men who should be consulted on all palace affairs.


将军向宠，性行淑均，晓畅军事，试用之于昔日，先帝称之曰能，是以众议举宠为督。愚以为营中之事，悉以咨之，必能使行阵和睦，优劣得所。

Xiang Chong has proved himself a fine general in battle, and the late Emperor believed in him. That is why the assembly has recommended him for overall command. It will keep the troops happy if he is consulted on all military matters.


亲贤臣，远小人，此先汉所以兴隆也；

The emperors of the Western Han chose their courtiers wisely, and their dynasty flourished.


亲小人，远贤臣，此后汉所以倾颓也。

The emperors of the Eastern Han chose poorly, and they doomed the empire to ruin.


先帝在时，每与臣论此事，未尝不叹息痛恨于桓、灵也。

Whenever the late Emperor discussed this problem with me, he lamented the failings of Emperors Huan and Ling.


侍中、尚书、长史、参军，此悉贞良死节之臣，愿陛下亲之信之，则汉室之隆，可计日而待也。

Advisors like Guo Youzhi, Fei Yi, Chen Zhen, Zhang Yi, and Jiang Wan – these are all men of great integrity and devotion. I encourage you to trust them, your majesty, if the house of Han is to rise again.


臣本布衣，躬耕于南阳，苟全性命于乱世，不求闻达于诸侯。

I begin as a common man, farming in my fields in Nanyang, doing what I could to survive in an age of chaos. I never had any interest in making a name for myself as a noble.


先帝不以臣卑鄙，猥自枉屈，三顾臣于草庐之中，咨臣以当世之事，

The late Emperor was not ashamed to visit my cottage and seek my advice.


由是感激，遂许先帝以驱驰。

Grateful for his regard, I responded to his appeal and threw myself into his service.


后值倾覆，受任于败军之际，奉命于危难之间，尔来二十有一年矣。先帝知臣谨慎，故临崩寄臣以大事也。

Now twenty-one years has passed, the late Emperor always appreciated my caution and, in his final days, entrusted me with his cause.


受命以来，夙夜忧叹，恐付托不效，以伤先帝之明，

Since that moment, I have been tormented day and night by the fear that I might let him down.


故五月渡泸，深入不毛。

That is why I crossed the Lu river at the height of summer, and entered the wastelands beyond.


今南方已定，甲兵已足，

Now the south has been subdued, and our forces are fully armed.


当奖率三军，北定中原，庶竭驽钝，攘除奸凶，兴复汉室，还于旧都。

I should lead our soldiers to conquer the northern heartland and attempt to remove the hateful traitors, restore the house of Han, and return it to the former capital.


此臣所以报先帝而忠陛下之职分也。

This the way I mean to honor my debt to the late Emperor and fulfill my duty to you.


至于斟酌损益，进尽忠言，则攸之、祎、允之任也。

Guo Youzhi, Fei Yi, and Dong Yun are the ones who should be making policy decisions and recommendations.


愿陛下托臣以讨贼兴复之效，

My only desire is to be permitted to drive out the traitors and restore the Han.


不效，则治臣之罪，以告先帝之灵。

If I should let you down, punish my offense and report it to the spirit of the late Emperor.


若无兴德之言，则责攸之、祎、允等之慢，以彰其咎；

If those three advisors should fail in their duties, then they should be punished for their negligence.


陛下亦宜自谋，以咨诹善道，察纳雅言，深追先帝遗诏，

Your Majesty, consider your course of action carefully. Seek out good advice, and never forget the late Emperor.


臣不胜受恩感激。今当远离，

I depart now on a long expedition, and I will be forever grateful if you heed my advice.


临表涕零，不知所言。

Blinded by my own tears, I know not what I write.
